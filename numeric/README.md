# Numeric 
A chaos big_integer class, I do some update from my old code when I was undergraduate.

I borrow some idea from https://github.com/chris-vaszauskas/bigint, especial in the instream operator overload.

A test scaffold to calculate N!, use `factorial.py` to check correctness.

It may bugs and not efficient enough, will optimize it in future.
