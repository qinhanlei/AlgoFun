Numeric 
=======
A chaos big_integer class, I do some update from my old code when I was undergraduate.  
I borrow some idea from `https://github.com/chris-vaszauskas/bigint`, especial in the instream operator overload.   
have a test scaffold, calculate N!, and a python version to check correctness.  
It may bugs and not efficient enough, I'll optimize it in future.
