#AlgoFun
##Introduction
I am very interested in algorithm, cause it's very fascinating.  
I'll just try some simple algorithms for fun.  

Almost all file can run by itself, use gcc/g++ command or other IDEs.  
I try to keep it simple and stupid, but as my limited capacity, I just try my best.

Life is short. :(  
So... live and learn, just for fun. :)

##Purpose
I think made a purpose may got more power and do it enduringly.  
So, I just list some thing thought of, below:

1. I want this simple fun project can help some guys which interested in 
(or hate, or just for homework, whatever) algorithm like me.

2. Again, I want K.I.S.S(Keep It Simple, Stupid), so it may be change 
style(coding, orgnazation...) frequently in the earlier stage. If some thing 
ugly or you have better way, tell me please. I'll so preciate it. 

3. Algorithm is beautiful, graceful, magnificent... I hope more and more 
guys like it, and I'm not going be a uglifier.

##Subjects
###0. Data Structure (planning) 
* Dance link

    * AVL Tree
    * Red Black Tree
    * Segment Tree
* Heap
    * Binomial Heap
    * Fibonacci Heap

###1. Searching (doing)
* Blind search
    * Simple BFS(Breadth-first) search modified from A\* algorithm.   
    * Simple DFS(Depth-first search), recursive and non-recursive(use stack) implement.
* Heuristic search
    * Simple A\*(A star) algorithm demo.  
    * IDA\*(Iterative Deepening A Star), recursive and non-recursive.
* ...

###2. Sorting (doing)  
* Exchange Sorts
    * Bubble Sort, easy, simple, stable, the first sorting algorithm that I learned, I miss that good old days.
    * Cocktail Sort, a Bubble Sort variant. doing...  
    * Quick Sort, simple implement, slower than Merge Sort which I have done, sigh...
* Selection Sorts
    * Select Sort, more simple, faster than Bubble Sort. but, unstable.
    * Heap Sort
* Insertion Sorts 
    * Insert Sort, the fast O(n^2) sort algorithm, and some optimize like binary method.
    * Binary Insert Sort, a binary optimize.  
    * Shell Sort, some try trial like binary optimize but got slower :(
* Merge Sorts
    * Merge sort
    * ...
* Distribution Sorts
    * Radix Sort 
* Hybrid Sorts 
    * Intro Sort 
* ...
