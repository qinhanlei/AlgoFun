Introduction
------------
I am very interested in algorithm, cause it's very fascinating.  
I'll just try some simple algorithms for fun.  

Almost all file can run by onself, use gcc/g++ command or other IDE thing.  
I try to write keep it simple and stupid, but as my limited capacity, I just try my best.

Life is short. :(  
So... live and learn, just for fun. :)

Subjects list
------------
1. Searching (almost path search, until now)
    * Simple A\*(A star) algorithm demo.  
        ps: to open the file "map.txt", recommend vim or others more powerful Editor.
    * Simple Breadth-first search modified from A\* algorithm.   
        ps: same as before.  
    * Simple Depth-first search, recursive and non-recursive(use stack) implement.
    * IDA\*(Iterative Deepening A Star), recursive and non-recursive.

2. Sorting (planning)

3. Numeric (planning)

4. Combinatorial (planning)

5. Dynamic Programming (planning)

6. Graph and Network (planning)

7. Computational Geometry (planning)
