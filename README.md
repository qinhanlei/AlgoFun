#AlgoFun
##Introduction
I am very interested in algorithm, cause it's very fascinating.  
I'll just try some simple algorithms for fun.  

Almost all file can run by onself, use gcc/g++ command or other IDE thing.  
I try to write keep it simple and stupid, but as my limited capacity, I just try my best.

Life is short. :(  
So... live and learn, just for fun. :)

##Purpose
I think made a purpose may got more power and do it enduringly.  
So, I just list some thing thought of, below:

1. I want this simple fun project can help some guys which interested in 
(or hate, or just for homework, whatever) algorithm like me.

2. Again, I want K.I.S.S(Keep It Simple, Stupid), so it may be change 
style(coding, orgnazation...) frequently earlier stage. If some thing 
ugly or you have more best way, tell me please. I'll so preciate it. 

3. Algorithm is beautiful, graceful, magnificent... I hope more and more 
guys like it, and... I'm not going be a uglifier.

###2. Sorting (doing)  
* Bubble Sort, easy, simple, stable, the first sorting algorithm that I learned, I miss that good old days.
    * Cocktail Sort, a Bubble Sort variant. doing...  
* Select Sort, more simple, faster than Bubble Sort. but, unstable.
